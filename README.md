### ðŸ’» Projects (coming soon)
I enjoy navigating the world of data. That's why I am currently working on a few data analytics projects in my free time to showcase here. Besides working on my technical skills (SQL, Power BI, Python, R), I understand that communicating how actionable findings meet business requirements is also important, thus my projects will reflect both my passion for data and the practical actions a business can take.
