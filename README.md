### üíª Projects
I enjoy using data to solve problems. That's why I am currently working on a few data projects in my free time to showcase here. Besides working on my technical skills, I understand that communicating how actionable findings meet business requirements is very important. Thus my projects will reflect both my passion for data and the practical actions a business can take.
